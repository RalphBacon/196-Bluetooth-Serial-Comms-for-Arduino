Before you start ensure you are in command mode, not communication mode. Power on the BT device
with the button held down or Pin 34 at VCC (max 3v3). Slow blinks indicates command mode.

AT - ensures we have contact. 
OK - No reply here means comms baud rate incorrect (must be 38400) or not in command mode

AT+RMAAD - remove any previous paired devices
OK

AT+ROLE=1 - set the device to initiator role, it can request the connecting from now on
OK

AT+RESET - sometimes needed after a role change
OK

AT+UART=38400,0,0 - keep the comms at a single baud rate, for both Arduino and Command mode
OK

AT+CMODE=1 - set to promiscuous mode, pair with any device that wants to
OK

AT+INQM=0,5,9 - set search mode for 5 devices in 9 seconds then stop
OK

AT+INIT - starts Serial Port Protocol, ignore an ERROR(17) after this command
OK

AT+INQ - now it goes and searches for devices
+INQ: 2016:5:248248,1F00,7FFF - found device (2016:5:248248), 1F00 is class of device and 7FFFF is signal strength
(delay as it continues its search)
OK

AT+RNAME?2016,5,248248 - query the name of the device. NOTE use commas not colons
+RNAME:responder
OK

AT+PAIR=2016,5,248248 - pair with the device
OK

AT+BIND=2016,5,248248 - bind to it permanently
OK

AT+CMODE=0 - only connect to paired devices from now on
OK

AT+LINK=2016,5,248248 - link to the device
OK

That is all. Power cycle the device removing any Pin 34 connection.
The devices will blink twice now quickly as you saw in the video as it connects to the paired device.
