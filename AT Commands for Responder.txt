Before you start ensure you are in command mode, not communication mode. Power on the BT device
with the button held down or Pin 34 at VCC (max 3v3). Slow blinks indicates command mode.

AT - ensures we have contact. 
OK - No reply here means comms baud rate incorrect (must be 38400) or not in command mode

AT+BAUD=38400,0,0
OK

AT+NAME=responder
OK

AT+ROLE=0 - this will not initiate a connection but wait until it receives a request from another device
OK

AT+RMAAD - clear any previously paired device
OK

AT+CMODE=0 = only allow connections to paired devices
OK

AT+RESET
OK

Now power off and back on. Device will blink rapidly waiting for a connection request.
