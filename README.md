AS part of a bigger project I need one-way comms between two Arduinos, as if they were connected together via the RX and TX pins. If required it also supports two-way, wireless comms.

Here I show you the basics of doing that but more importantly I go through Martyn Currey's instructions on how to pair two Bluetooth devices (eg an HC05 and HC06 or just two HC05s) so that they will only connect to each other (automatically) upon power up.

Note that you can't use two HC06s because an HC06 cannot act as an initiator, only a responder.  

A complete list of the commands you need for both Initiator and Responder are included in my GitHub to save you the bother of finding each command.
